- Identify the key metrics and visuals you want to include.
- Sketch a layout for your dashboard (e.g., header, charts, filters).

##### *Step 2: Create Charts*
- Use the steps above to create individual charts for each metric.

##### *Step 3: Add Slicers for Interactivity*
1. Select your Pivot Table or chart.
2. Go to the *Insert* tab.
3. Click *Slicer*.
4. Choose the fields you want to filter by (e.g., Region, Year).

##### *Step 4: Arrange and Format*
1. Copy and paste your charts onto a single worksheet.
2. Arrange them in a logical layout.
3. Use shapes, text boxes, and colors to create a professional design.

##### *Step 5: Add Dynamic Titles*
